# AutoSortCoords
An Excel VBS macro that will sort coordinates by their distance from the last coordinate to make the shortest route through a list or coordinates.

Proof of concent is shown in the image below. The first image is a path of 305 coordinates put through the TSP website. The second image is a path of the same coordinates if you sorted by distance based on the origin location. The last image is the path after you run the macro on the same coordinates.
